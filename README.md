## About the App
AiDvisor is a career quiz featuring both a general, catch-all quiz, and custom quizzes tailored for your specific interests by Google's AI model, Gemini.
After taking the quiz, you will get a detailed report with several job titles you may want to look into based on your quiz answers.
## Usage
To get started using the app, you will need your own Gemini API key. Don't worry, they're free! With just a few button clicks on Google's Gemini API page, you'll have a key ready to use.
Once you've obtained your key, enter it into the footer of the web page and you'll be able to start using the app.
The key is saved to your local browser, so you shouldn't need to enter it again until the cache is cleared.
